```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Covid Report
The total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. The death rate is about 1.7%. We can see large spikes in cumulative cases at the end of 2020 and in the beginning of 2022. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

- formatting can be changed with function prettyNum, just like the *total number of US cases*

I also want to show the chart:

``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
